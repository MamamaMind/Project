This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the World Life Expectancy dataset to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.  
The dataset contains country-level life expectancy data across multiple years, but includes duplicate records and missing values that must be handled before any meaningful analysis can be performed.
